# Function Programs in C

This section contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions.  
Functions help in breaking a program into smaller modular blocks, making the code reusable and easy to debug.

1. Program to calculate the factorial of a number using a function.
2. Program to find the maximum of two numbers using a function.
